            <h3>About the game</h3>
            <p>
              A mobile game where you control two characters that are tethered
              together, but one moves vertically, while the other moves
              horizontally. You will have to go through narrow paths and avoid
              obstacle to reach your goal: pass through the bubble wand.

            <h3>My work in the game</h3>
            <p>
              As a programmer, I've developed the game mechanics, controllers
              and scoring system. I've also worked on a tool to make a
              bidirectional parallax effect.

            <p>
              A third person Hack and Slash game where you're the only one with
              good taste in music in the whole city. Smash AI Controlled Robots,
              Kick things and do someparkour stuff, all of this with the beat of
              the music.

            <h3>My work in the game</h3>
            <p>
              This game ended up being a prototype of a rhythm-based Hack and
              Slash. I've developed player movement, Combat System, Parkour
              mechanics and AI using a Behavior Tree approach.

              A 2D Action Shooter where you're tasked with saving the world from
              dangerous insects, using multiple weapons. Be careful not to lose
              your arms.

            <p>
              I was responsible for making character controls and interactions
              as well as the weapons related mechanics. I've also made and
              implemented some particle effects (like blood) as well as game
              sounds and the leader-board system with the Game Jolt API.
